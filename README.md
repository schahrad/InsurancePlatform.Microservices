# InsurancePlatform.Microservices

# InsurancePlatform.Microservices

A sample microservices-based backend for an insurance domain, built with **.NET 8** and **C#**, plus a **Blazor WebAssembly** frontend.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a professional, production-style architecture with:

- Independent business microservices
- A dedicated Identity Provider (IdP) using OpenID Connect (OpenIddict – planned)
- A Blazor WebAssembly UI as presentation layer
- Clean separation between presentation, business logic, and data access

> Status: Early development (solution structure + initial Blazor UI are in place; business logic, databases, and IdP integration are being added step by step).
